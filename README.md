## Hi there. I'm Laura ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Engineering at Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking foward to become a Fullstack Developer through Driven Education's course.
- ðŸ¤” I love solving problems, physics and math.
- ðŸ’¬ Interested in computer modeling and numerical simulation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Also very interested in Data Science.
- âš¡ Technology is also a big passion


In my college I was part of a research group in the area of computational fluid dynamics, being initially a volunteer for 2 years and a fellow for another 2 years. That's where my interest in programming started.

During my vacation, in 2022, I decided to take CS50X, a free "Introduction to Computer Science" course from the University of Harvard, and completely fell in love with programming.

Since then, I've also completed CS50x's follow-on courses "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript", "CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python", "CS50's Understanding Technology" and "CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python".

Solving the challenging projects in these courses encouraged me to want to learn even more. <!--- So I joined Driven Education's course, a nine-month bootcamp in which we develop several projects. -->
