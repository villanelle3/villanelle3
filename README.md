## Hi there. I'm Laura 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently studying Engineering at Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE).
- 🌱 I’m looking foward to become a Fullstack Developer <!--- through Driven Education's course. -->
- 🤔 I love solving problems, physics and math.
- 💬 Interested in computer modeling and numerical simulation.
- 👯 Also very interested in Data Science.
- ⚡ Technology is also a big passion


In my college I was part of a research group in the area of computational fluid dynamics, being initially a volunteer for 2 years and a fellow for another 2 years. That's where my interest in programming started.

During my vacation, in 2022, I decided to take CS50X, a free "Introduction to Computer Science" course from the University of Harvard, and completely fell in love with programming.

Since then, I've also completed CS50x's follow-on courses "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript", "CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python", "CS50's Understanding Technology" and "CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python".

Solving the challenging projects in these courses encouraged me to want to learn even more. So I joined British School of Creative Arts and Technology's course to became a Fullstack python Developer <!--- So I joined Driven Education's course, a nine-month bootcamp in which we develop several projects. -->
